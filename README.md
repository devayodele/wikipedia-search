# Wikipedia Search App

---

This repository contains a web app that searches Wikipedia and displays the top 20 results on a page. It works by inputing a search query into an input field in the app. The query is sent to Wikipedia using AJAX calls and results are displayed on the page in the format of a regular search engine.

In this repository:

- Use of fetch() API to make HTTP GET requests.
- Use of async/await keywords to make the asynchronous code looks cleaner.
